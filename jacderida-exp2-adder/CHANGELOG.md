### New Features

 - <csr-id-9aecbb2e6a641e50fb1c97bfbc3fbca200dee7cb/> rename crate to add-lib
 - <csr-id-c71961b732d9146f08ea5f428e2fe75259b0d2e0/> create adder binary
   This is just duplicating the little workspace setup described in the Rust book. The strange
   `jacderida-exp` prefixes are just to make sure the crate names are unique and clearly designated as
   being experimental. I plan to publish these to my own account on crates.io.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-d17cf9b31d923d042767a8ddc2d77792bc4eb8ee/> use correct input name for action
