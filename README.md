# Rust Workspace Release Experiments

For experiments with automated release and publishing for Rust workspace repositories.

This is basically duplicating the little setup described in Chapter 13 of 'The Rust Programming Language', but it's adding a 'jacderida-exp' prefix to the crate names just to make sure they are unique and clearly designated as experimental.
